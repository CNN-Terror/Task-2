**In progress:**
* Data binarization (not done because we have a flow but not a method that our main flow could use. UPDATE: It should be working in test.py now))

**Done:**
* write method to extract word images from full page
* Features extractions
* Define Word class
* Compute distance matrix between train and test words

**TODO (high level):**
* Apply DTW on two features vectors
* Evaluation (recall + precision)
* Expected output for KWS (slide 24 from exercise session 8)
